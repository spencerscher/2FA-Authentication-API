# Multi-Factor-Authentication
Multi-Factor Authentication API that allows users to create accounts and enable 2FA. The current TOTP 2FA implementation will generate unique QR codes to scan into a multi-factor app of choice (Google Authenticator).

This multi-factor API uses JWTs to authenticate users on protected endpoints. Each JWT (1 hr expiry time) is signed with the respective users' hashed password in order to invalidate any non-expired JWTs on a password reset. Therefore, when a password is reset, all non-expired JWTs for a particular account will be invalidated as the signer has now changed for that account.

This API uses MongoDB as a database. Please add your MongoDB connection URL into `db/db.js`.

#Installation and Running API
